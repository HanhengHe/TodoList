- This is a personal practice of Web Development using *React--Node.js--Express--MongoDB*.
- Some style of the front-end was not finished yet, also the MongoDB was not connected.
I am coding for the back-end currently, and since it's a simple practice, it would be finished within one or two days.

- I will come back and show more detail about this web app once I finish the skeleton of it.
